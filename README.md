# Internship-Assignment

PLEASE CONSIDER READING THIS BEFORE RUNNING OR TESTING THE WEB APP:-
1. This is not a responsive website and for some reason this project looks better on a **15.6inch 1920x1080 screen resolution** as it was developed in this one 
(also make sure to zoom in or out as per your viewing experience). 
2. This is my very first proper reactjs project in which I've implemented my learnings as well as
3. This is only a sample assignment frontend project for one of my internship opportunities in which i was asked to build a clone of the original website named Lenster.xyz .
